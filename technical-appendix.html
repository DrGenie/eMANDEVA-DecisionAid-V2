    <h1>MANDEVAL Technical Appendix</h1>
    <p class="small">
      This appendix explains how the MANDEVAL tool organises cost and benefit inputs. It is
      written so that you can plug in your own best estimates and update them over time.
      No values are hard coded in the tool; all defaults can be replaced by country teams.
    </p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Cost parameters</h2>
    <p>
      The tool keeps the cost structure deliberately simple and transparent. All costs are entered
      in the same currency, usually per year for a given mandate design:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Cost item</th>
        <th>Examples</th>
        <th>How MANDEVAL uses it</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Administration and delivery</td>
        <td>
          Staff time to administer mandates, maintain registers, update IT systems,
          respond to queries and issue certificates or QR codes.
        </td>
        <td>
          Entered as a single amount in the <em>Costs</em> tab and added directly to total cost.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Communication and outreach</td>
        <td>
          Public information campaigns, hotline services, community engagement,
          translation and accessible formats.
        </td>
        <td>
          Entered as a single amount and added to total cost. You can separate recurring
          and one-off activities in your own costing sheet if useful.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Enforcement and compliance</td>
        <td>
          Inspection, compliance checks, appeals, legal and administrative procedures
          related to non-compliance.
        </td>
        <td>
          Entered as a single amount and added to total cost. It can be set to zero if
          enforcement is minimal or handled under existing budgets.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Compensation and support</td>
        <td>
          Compensation schemes for vaccine injury, hardship support for people who lose work
          because of mandates, and costs of processing exemption requests.
        </td>
        <td>
          Entered as a single amount and added to total cost. It can be treated as a pooled
          fund if individual payments are uncertain.
        </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
      The tool calculates <strong>total cost</strong> as the sum of these four components.
      Countries can align each item with a more detailed costing template if they wish.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Benefit parameters</h2>
    <p>
      MANDEVAL focuses on one main health outcome: lives saved due to higher vaccine coverage
      under a mandate compared with a reference situation. Users provide the key inputs:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Benefit item</th>
        <th>Definition</th>
        <th>How MANDEVAL uses it</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Lives saved per 100,000</td>
        <td>
          Expected reduction in deaths per 100,000 people in the covered population due to the
          mandate. This should come from your own epidemiological modelling or external evidence.
        </td>
        <td>
          Combined with the population covered in the configuration step to estimate total
          lives saved for the scenario.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Monetary value per life saved</td>
        <td>
          The monetary value used by your country team for one life saved. This may be based
          on a value of a statistical life (VSL), value of a life year (VOLY) or other national
          guidance on valuing mortality reductions.
        </td>
        <td>
          Multiplied by total lives saved to obtain the total monetary benefit for the scenario.
          If you prefer not to monetise lives saved, you can set this to zero and focus on
          natural units.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Indicative public support</td>
        <td>
          A simple 0–100 index representing expected public support or acceptability
          for the mandate design. This can come from survey data, preference studies or
          expert judgement.
        </td>
        <td>
          Used for traffic-light signalling and ranking. It does not enter the benefit–cost
          ratio directly but helps distinguish otherwise similar scenarios.
        </td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Derived indicators</h2>
    <p>
      Once costs and benefits are entered, the tool computes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Total lives saved</strong> as lives saved per 100,000 multiplied by the population
        covered in the scenario.</li>
      <li><strong>Total monetary benefit</strong> as total lives saved multiplied by the monetary
        value per life saved.</li>
      <li><strong>Benefit–cost ratio (BCR)</strong> as total monetary benefit divided by total cost,
        when both are positive.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      Countries can adjust the underlying values over time as new evidence emerges. The purpose
      of the tool is to make these assumptions visible and easy to modify, not to embed any fixed
      global benchmark.
